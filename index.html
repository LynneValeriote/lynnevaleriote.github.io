	<h3>My Work</h3>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">OLG Play.Smart</h5>
	<p>
		I wrote the Roulette section of the Play.Smart website. It walks players through game play steps, the odds of winning, and 
        the etiquette of game play. The challenge was to subtly weave in tips on how to play responsibly without being preachy.

	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">Ford Motor Company of Canada</h5>
	<p>
		The Ford Electric social media campaign was intended to jolt people in terms of what they expect from  
		Ford, and to create awareness of Ford’s electric vehicle offering. Our team came up with a series of 
		quick 10- and 15-second “whimsical" spots meant to grab attention and show Ford in the EV space. The core 
		idea was that electricity isn’t a passing fad for powering vehicles. 
        <a href="resources/FordEV-Sprint1-Copy-LV-v5.pdf" target="blank">View Ford EV script (pdf).</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I've also written copy for many other Ford and Lincoln projects, and between 2012-2017, I provided 
		ongoing editing and Canadianization work for both the Ford and Lincoln model year change-over vehicles, 
		including all of the cars, CUVs & SUVs, and Trucks.  
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">Campbell Canada</h5>
	<p>
		I wrote original copy and I edited copy leveraged from the U.S. for this Campbell's Canada corporate transparency 
        website. It highlights the Canadian Campbell's product lines, describing how they are produced, and what's 
		in the food. It address GMO and gluten-free ingredients, and encourages consumers to engage with Campbell's 
		in a conversation about what's in their food.
		<a href="http://whatsinmyfood.ca/" target="blank">View site.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, for 2+ years, I wrote Campbell's Soup Recipe Emails, V8 Emails, and social media posts. Here are two 
        Campbell's Soup Emails I like.
		<a href="resources/1001_Email_EN2.jpg" target="blank">View Warm Your Soul email (pdf)</a> and 
		<a href="resources/1004_Email_EN.jpg" target="blank">View Enjoy This Meal email (pdf).</a>
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">World Vision</h5>
	<p>
		I helped launch the award-winning <a href="https://nochildforsale.ca/" target="blank">World Vision No Child for Sale</a> website a few years ago, and created some of the content updates for it, post launch. I also researched and wrote 
		<a href="http://nochildforsale.ca/?attachment_id=1410" target="blank">this infographic</a> about child labour in the chocolate industry. 
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">Playtex Sport Period FAQ</h5>
	<p>
			Playtex wanted a stronger FAQ section for their site to both engage and inform pre-teens and teens, as well 
			as their parents/guardians. I brainstormed, researched, and wrote the copy for this section of the site 
			in addition to other marketing initiatives at the time. In writing this, I was mindful of tone-of-voice 
			for both teens and their parents. I did not assume that everyone had a "mom and a dad" and therefore I 
			tried to show an awareness of the new reality of blended families.

	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">TD Canada Trust - Get Saving</h5>
	<p>
			This is a microsite I worked on a few years ago for TD Canada Trust. Our challenge was to engage 
			Millennials to consider how to start investing their money. TD wanted a fresh approach that would 
			speak to this demographic. Leveraging the YouTube live-blogging videos emerging at the time, the 
			agency pitched the premise of a financially savvy video blogger who's created her own video series to 
			demystify and explain the bank's financial instruments, and share how she's been using them to help reach 
			her own financial milestones. 
			<a href="http://www.tdgetsaving.com/#/get-saving" target="blank">View TD Get Saving site.</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		I wrote the video scripts for "Get Saving", "Start Early", "Tools to help you Save", "What is an RSP?" 
		and "RSPs: For much more than retirement". We tried to encourage TD to use more relaxed and casual 
		language, but this is as far as they would go. I find the acting to be a bit stiff, but overall, the 
		concepts are clean and clear. I also collaborated on some of the calculators, and the ideas for the 
		Savings Tips. I wrote the majority of the savings tips, and all of the RSP & TFSA FAQs.
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">TD VISA Direct</h5>
	<p>
		I brainstormed concepts with an Art Director, and wrote the video script and site copy for this primer on 
		transferring money overseas using VISA Direct. Our goal was to appeal to the perspectives of New Canadians 
		concerned with finding better ways to send their money to family members back home.

	</p>

	<p>
		I've worked on many other TD Canada Trust projects like the TD Music Access site, TD Waterhouse Mobile 
		Optimization, TD Cross Border Banking, TD RRSP Online Content, UGO Wallet App and more.
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">Ontario Tourism Marketing Partnership</h5>
	<p>
		Here's an autumn edition of the Great Drives campaign for Ontario Tourism that I wrote a few years back.
		<a href="resources/OTMP_fall_e-mail_03.jpg" target="blank">View site (pdf).</a>
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">Food Network Canada</h5>
	<p>
		I worked on the launch of the foodtv.ca site back in 2001, and our "On the Burner" online magazine 
		(within the site) was a labour of love for us. Each month, we'd develop recipes, cook, style and 
		photograph food, write articles, interview TV hosts, create helpful guides. Here are two of my 
        favourite issues:
		<a href="resources/2002_10_Thanksgiving_Spread.jpg" target="blank">View Thanksgiving Spread (pdf).</a> 
		and 
		<a href="resources/2002_11_Entertaining_Food.jpg" target="blank">View Entertaining Food (pdf).</a>
