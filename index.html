	<h3>My Work</h3>

    <h5 id="lv-project-title">1. Toronto Dominion Bank Group</h5>
	<p>
    <h6 id="lv-project-title">1.1 MBNA Work</h6>
	<p>
		I co-designed chatbot user dialogue flows and wrote conversational copy for a proof-of-concept AI chatbot project for MBNA credit cards. Here is the initial master dialogue flow copydeck and the accompanying chatbot flow deck with the dialogue copy embedded right into the flow - see the yellow stickies.

	</p>
    <p>
		And here is the master copydeck containing the first batch of FAQs (of three batches total) that I re-crafted for the chatbot interface.

	</p>
    <p>
		I wrote copy for the Apple Pay flows on the MBNA mobile site, including microcopy elements such as global alt tag copy, navigational direction for Apple Pay provisioning, and error states messaging.

	</p>
    <h6 id="lv-project-title">1.2 TD Work</h6>
	<p>
		I also wrote product and marketing copy for several TD projects. Here are some marketing copy pages I wrote for the "About TD" section of the TD website. Please note: very minor edits have been made to the copy at the time of publishing.
		<a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/" target="blank">View the "About TD" page.</a>

	</p>
    <h5 id="lv-project-title">2. Nissan Canada</h5>
	<p>
		I developed the 2019 model year refresh copy for the full line-up of vehicles on the Nissan Canada website. Here is a sample of the copy I wrote for the newly remodeled 2019 Nissan Altima section pages. Note: the images and copydeck show a TBD section in the layouts - a placeholder that was to be developed by a separate team.

	<p>   
        During my time working on the Nissan product refresh, I also developed an effective system for better managing legal disclaimers for both Critical Mass and their Nissan Canada client.

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">3. OLG Play.Smart</h5>
	<p>
		I wrote the Roulette section of OLG's Play Smart website. I structured the content, and wrote the copy for this section, walking players through game play steps, the odds of winning, and the etiquette of game play. Part of the challenge was to subtly weave in tips on how to play responsibly without being preachy. Note: I did not write the script for the video contained within this section of the site.

	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">4. Ford Motor Company of Canada</h5>
	<p>
		The Ford Electric social media campaign was intended to create awareness of Ford’s electric vehicle offering and to "jolt" people in what they expect from Ford. Our team came up with a series of quick 10- and 15-second “whimsical" spots meant purely to grab attention and showcase Ford in the EV space. The core idea was that electricity isn’t a passing fad for powering vehicles. Here's the video script I wrote for the campaign.
        <a href="resources/FordEV-Sprint1-Copy-LV-v5.pdf" target="blank">View Ford EV script (pdf).</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I've also developed copy for many other Ford and Lincoln projects. Between 2012-2017, I did 
		ongoing editing and Canadianization work for both the Ford and Lincoln model year change-over vehicles, 
		including all of the cars, CUVs and SUVs, and trucks.  
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">5. Campbell Canada</h5>
	<p>
		I researched and wrote original copy, and edited copy leveraged from the U.S. for "What's In My Food.ca", a Campbell's 
        Canada corporate transparency website. The site explains what goes into the Canadian Campbell's products, how they are produced, and Campbell's choices around specific ingredients. My challenge was to find Canadian-specific product and regulatory information, and encourage consumers to engage in a dialogue with Campbell's.

	</p>
	<p>
		Also, for 2+ years, I wrote Campbell's Soup Recipe Emails, V8 Emails, and social media posts. Here are two 
        Campbell's Soup Emails I like.
		<a href="resources/1001_Email_EN2.jpg" target="blank">View Warm Your Soul email (pdf)</a> and 
		<a href="resources/1004_Email_EN.jpg" target="blank">View Kid-Friendly Meal email (pdf).</a>
	</p>

	
        <h5 id="lv-project-title">6. BMO Financial Group</h5>
	<p>
		For two years, I researched and wrote curriculum for the BMO Institute for Learning - Global Board of Directors Learning App. I distilled complex financial industry-related subject matter into concise, easy-to-understand curriculum for board members to reference in preparation for global board meetings. Each quarterly release featured current affairs articles from five content pillars: financial industry, regulatory, business of banking, risk, and products & services. This BoD release sample focuses on the emergence and versatility of blockchain technology in the financial industry.

	</p>
	
       
    <h5 id="lv-project-title">7. World Vision</h5>
	<p>
		I helped write and launch the award-winning <a href="resources/World Vision No Child For Sale Website2.png" target="blank">No Child for Sale website (pdf)</a> and created content updates for it, post launch. The goal was to create a fresh, slightly edgy and in-your-face site that would made an impact, and raise awareness on the issues of child slavery and ethical supply chains. I also researched and wrote 
		<a href="resources/Ethical Chocolate Infographic_NCFS R1.pdf" target="blank">this Ethical Chocolate infographic (pdf)</a> about child labour in the chocolate industry. 
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">8. Playtex Sport Period FAQ</h5>
	<p>
			Playtex wanted a stronger FAQ section for their site to both engage and inform pre-teens and teens, as well 
			as their parents/guardians. I brainstormed, researched, and wrote the copy for this section of the site 
			alongside other marketing initiatives at the time. In writing this, I was mindful of tone-of-voice for the tweens and teens of today, and their parents. I did not assume that everyone had a "mom and a dad" and therefore I tried to show an awareness of the new reality of blended families.

	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">9. TD Canada Trust - Get Saving</h5>
	<p>
			<a href="resources/TD Get Saving Site.jpg" target="blank">The TD Get Saving microsite (pdf)</a> was designed to engage Millennials to start investing their money. TD wanted a fresh approach that would speak to this demographic. Leveraging the YouTube live-blogging videos emerging at the time, we pitched the premise of a financially savvy video blogger who's created her own video series to demystify and explain the bank's financial instruments, and share how she's been using them to help reach her own financial milestones. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I wrote the video scripts for "Get Saving", "Start Early", "Tools to help you Save", "What is an RSP?" 
		and "RSPs: For much more than retirement". I also collaborated on some of the calculators, and I wrote many of the savings tips, and all of the RSP and TFSA FAQs. <a href="resources/2010_07_22_FIC_Script2.0_v04_FINAL.pdf" target="blank">View the "Start Early" script (pdf).</a>
	</p>

	<h5 id="lv-project-title">10. TD VISA Direct</h5>
	<p>
		I brainstormed concepts with an Art Director, and wrote the video script and site copy for this primer on 
		transferring money overseas using VISA Direct. Our goal was to appeal to the perspectives of New Canadians 
		concerned with finding better ways to send their money to family members back home.
		<a href="resources/TDB01-332_TDVisaMoneyTransfer_VideoScript_v04.01.pdf" target="blank">View TD VISA Direct video script (pdf).</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		I've worked on many other TD Canada Trust projects like the TD Music Access site, TD Waterhouse Mobile 
		Optimization, TD Cross Border Banking, TD RRSP Online Content, UGO Wallet App and more.
